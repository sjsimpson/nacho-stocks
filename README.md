Welcome to Nacho Stocks! A personal project of mine, designed to help people (like me) who are nervous about actively trading stocks, and giving them a playground to do so!

This project is a work in progress, but can be found at here (insert URL at some point).

It was built using my Material Component Library, and ar a way to add more components to that library.

Enjoy!
